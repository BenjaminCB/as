Finish running the Huffman algorithm and encoding the example string on slide 19. Solve CLRS3 16.3-3. By how much the text with the frequencies of characters as given in the exercise would be compressed?
Finding shortest paths from a single source vertex and finding a minimum spanning tree are graph optimization problems solvable by greedy algorithms. We looked at Prim's algorithm in the lecture. Consider Kruskal's and Dijkstra's algorithms. For each of these algorithms, describe:
    - what is the greedy choice made in each step of the algorithm?
    - what is the sub-problem that remains after each step of the algorithm? (Remember, the sub-problem should "look" like the original problem, only smaller)
Solve CLRS3 16.2-5. Prove your greedy choice property.
Solve CLRS3 16.1-4. Argue that your algorithm correctly finds an optimal solution.Â (Hint: Prove by contradiction. Assume that the algorithm's solution with k lecture halls is not optimal and the k-th lecture hall is not necessary, then, investigate the first activity scheduled in this lecture hall.)
