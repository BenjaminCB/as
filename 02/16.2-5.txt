let S be an optimal solution not containing the greedy choice x.
The first point n has to be covered therefore there must be,
an interval (u,v) which is to left of the i.e u is strictly
smaller than n. replacing with the greedy choice (n, n+1)
will still enclose n and all other points that (u,v) would
enclose.
