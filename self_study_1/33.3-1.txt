case for p1 (proof by contradiction):
    assume that the convex hull does not contain point p1.
    The first connection in the hull p0 to pn, must have a higher angle than
    p0 to p1, since p1 is the first element in the sorted list.
    Therefore p1 must be on the outside of the convex hull, which is a contradiction,
    since all points should be on or within the hull.

case for pm: almost excactly the same argument
